Exercise: Password Brute-Force-Attack
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given a wordlist.txt file which stores all 4 character strings from "aaaa" to
"zzzz".

We have used an SQL injection attack to get hashed passwords from a database
table. From the size of the Hash value we can guess that a "SHA-512" algorithm
has been used.

Try to crack the following Hash value (get the plain text password for the Hash
value):

i)  For every string in the wordlist.txt file, calculate the "SHA-512" Hash value

ii) If the calculated Hash value matches the given Hash value, you know the
    plaintext password - it's the used string.

Implement all the code within the "BruteForceTest" file.

Tip: Have a look to the "FileReaderTest" to find out how to read text files.
